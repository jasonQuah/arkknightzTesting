# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## How to debug locally

If this is the first time you run the apps, please do on following step:
1. Ensure NodeJS is installed to your Device.
2. Use Powershell/ Command prompt/ VS Code Terminal and direct it to the project folder.
3. Execute this script 'npm install' to get node modules based on package.json
4. Ensure node module folder is exist in the project repo folder.

After all steps done, you can use 'npm start' to start debug locally.


## Commit changes
Please do not commit package module to repo eg: node_modules


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Run using docker container

1. Ensure your device have installed the Docker. 
2. Use following command to run in development environment
    `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d –build`
3. All the setting on using docker compose are on the docker-compose-{environment}.yml file
4. Environment development has been set to allow us auto refresh when saving file just like using `npm start` command.
5. Please take note that currently this project set the variable on the docker-compose files directly instead of .env due to Docker's limitation on getting variables from external files.
